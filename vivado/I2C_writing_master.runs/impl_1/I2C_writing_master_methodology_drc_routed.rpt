2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin transmitting_reg_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin transmitting_reg_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell scl_internal_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) scl_enable_reg[0]/PRE, scl_enable_reg[1]/PRE, scl_enable_reg[2]/PRE,
scl_enable_reg[3]/PRE, scl_enable_reg[4]/PRE, scl_enable_reg[5]/PRE
scl_internal_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) I2C_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on scl relative to clock(s) I2C_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch scl_enable_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin scl_enable_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch scl_enable_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin scl_enable_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch scl_enable_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin scl_enable_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch scl_enable_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin scl_enable_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch scl_enable_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin scl_enable_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch scl_enable_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin scl_enable_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch transmitting_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin transmitting_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
